Generate Data generic and locale specific

## Faking random values
The faker allows to generate random values, such as integers, uuids, or words.

`node random.js`{{execute}}

## Faking locale data
The faker supports localized data to some extent. Note that the locales are finished to various levels.

`node locale-faker.js`{{execute}}

The example generates fake data in Russian language.
