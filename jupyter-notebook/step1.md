You will now run a Docker container for Jupyter Notebook. Note: this may take up to 3 minutes, because of the size of the container image.

##Â Task

Run the Jupyter Notebook container image:

`docker run -p 8888:8888 -d --name jupyter --volume "$PWD":/script  jupyter/scipy-notebook:2c80cf3537ca`{{execute}}

When the container is running, execute this statement:
`docker logs jupyter`{{execute}}

it would be nice to get hold of the token from the logs, but I have not yet got that working
`JUPYTER_TOKEN=$(docker logs jupyter | grep -oP "token=\K[a-z0-9^]+" )`{{execute}}

and check the value of the token:

`echo $JUPYTER_TOKEN`{{execute}}

Next, you can open the Jupyter Notebook at 
 https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

Note: you need the value of the Jupyter Token to login to the environment.
## Further prepare the container
To prepare the container we will run a script inside the container to install several Python packages

First, copy the script into the container
`docker cp prepareContainer.sh jupyter:/script/prepareContainer.sh`{{execute}}
This will copy the local file prepareContainer.sh into the container's /script directory; it will be a root owned file that cannot be run straightaway.

Next, copy the script, make the copy executable and then run the script inside the container:
`docker exec -d jupyter bash -c 'cp /script/prepareContainer.sh ~/prepareContainer.sh && chmod +x ~/prepareContainer.sh && ~/prepareContainer.sh'`{{execute}}

Next, run the script inside the container:
`docker exec -d jupyter sh /home/jovyan/prepareContainer.sh`{{execute}}

Run this script to execute all steps:
`sh runPrep.sh`{{execute}}
